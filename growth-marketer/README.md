# Challenge

Croct currently has a solid client base in Brazil, which uses our personalization platform to create unique user experiences and optimize buyers' journeys.

Now, we are beginning to expand our presence in the USA.

We already have a standard traction strategy that includes traditional channels like LinkedIn Ads, Meta Ads, SEO, events, social media, webinars, etc.

But as a resourceful, curious, and inquiring growth marketer, what approach would you take to go beyond that?

How would you ensure that you generate leads in this new market by exploring these channels in a disruptive way?

Which other channels would you leverage, and what unique strategies would you implement on each of them?

Justify your choices by explaining your thought process and showcasing your ability to craft a long-term strategy independently.

**Monthly numbers**
- Marketing budget: $10,000 per month
- Target cost per marketing lead: $40
- Goal: bring 250 leads in one month

**ICP**
- CROs, CMOs, Marketing VPs, or growth managers working for B2C SaaS PLG companies (their user acquisition is usually more focused on the website rather than on the mobile app) that have:
From $10MM to $20MM on revenue
  - At least five people on the growth team (usually 50 to 500 people in the whole company)
  - A dedicated developer for the growth team
  - A website with more than 50k MAU

**Target industries**
- Financial services
- Education
- Travel
- Beauty

## Deliverable: 

Always remember that this challenge aims to understand your strategic thinking and assess your skills for thinking outside the box when traditional channels are not an option.

We don’t expect you to create an end-to-end growth strategy, given that we already have a proper operation in place.

List two to three non-traditional marketing traction channel/strategy ideas that don’t include the ones listed in this document (or others alike).

Write down one or two paragraphs for each item in your list, summing up why you chose it, giving a rough overview of how you would implement it (or which sources you would use to learn how to implement it), and how it would bring us more qualified leads.

Explain how at least one of those strategies would make us go viral. Please don’t use more than one or two pages in total to elaborate on your proposed approaches.
